## A Word of Warning
The code provided here is intended to be a way for you to figure out where you went wrong if necessary.

I encourage you to use this tutorial as a resource to "prime the pump" or to get un-stuck in your own projects.  But make sure to attempt each step on your own if you want to get the most out of this tutorial.

I strongly suggest turning off any AI features that your IDE/Editor may provide that will fill in work for you.


## Requirements
This tutorial assumes that you have your environment set up to run [Go](https://go.dev/) code.  It also assumes that you have a basic familiarity with the Go programming language.  The tutorial has been created with Go 1.24 but any reasonably close version should be the same for this purpose.

I will try to update it if there are any major changes in the future that break the tutorial.

In order to follow along with this tutorial you will need an IDE and a computer capable of running it, it does not need to be an extremely powerful computer.

I have used GoLand as my IDE, but I didn't use any features that aren't standard features of any modern IDE, and you're welcome to use whatever you prefer.

Lastly it will be helpful if you have an API testing tool such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) installed.  If you have a preference for another similar tool then please feel free to use that.  The only thing that really matters is the ability to easily send and receive JSON data to interact with the server we will be building.
